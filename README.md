# 📚 JavaScript Basics – Interactive Learning Repo

Welcome to **JavaScript Basics**, an open, beginner-friendly repository for learning and practicing core JavaScript concepts. This project is designed to help you understand JavaScript step by step — with real, working examples that run right in your browser.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

This repo contains a simple `index.html` page that loads multiple JavaScript files. Each file focuses on a specific fundamental concept:

| File Name         | Description                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `script.js`       | Your main practice file / entry point    |
| `arrays.js`       | Examples of arrays and array operations  |
| `string.js`       | String manipulation & concatenation      |
| `if_Else.js`      | Conditional statements (`if`/`else`)     |
| `switch_Case.js`  | `switch` statements                      |
| `loops.js`        | Loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)     |

## 💻 How to Use This Repo

1️⃣ **Clone the Repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muthembw/Understanding-JavaScript.git
2️⃣ Open the Project

Use VS Code, Sublime, or any code editor you like.

3️⃣ Run the HTML File

Simply open index.html in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge — anything works).

All the JavaScript files listed above will load automatically.

Open your browser console (Right-click → Inspect → Console) to see the outputs.

4️⃣ Read & Modify

Each .js file has clear examples.

Try changing variable values, adding console.log statements, or writing your own code to test your understanding.

5️⃣ Keep It Organized

If you want to add new examples, create a new .js file and link it in index.html like this:

<script src="yourNewFile.js"></script>
✨ What You’ll Learn
✅ Variables & Data Types
✅ Operators
✅ Conditional Logic (if, else, switch)
✅ Loops (for, while)
✅ Functions
✅ Objects & Arrays
✅ DOM Manipulation (coming soon)

⚡ Tips for Best Learning
Always open your console — that’s where you see what your code does.

Make small edits, save, refresh the page — repeat.

Break the code on purpose — then fix it. Debugging is real learning.

Use console.log generously — it’s your best friend.
